##TEMPLATE: 

In AngularJS, templates are written with HTML that contains AngularJS-specific elements and attributes

These are the types of AngularJS elements and attributes you can use:

##Directive: 
An attribute or element that augments an existing DOM element or represents a reusable DOM component.

##Markup:
The double curly brace notation {{ }} to bind expressions to elements is built-in AngularJS markup.

##Filter:
 Formats data for display.

##Form controls:
 Validates user input.
